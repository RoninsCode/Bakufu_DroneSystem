# AI-Enhanced Drone Control System

I am developing an advanced autonomous drone control system that combines PX4/ROS with modern AI approaches, particularly reinforcement learning. This project represents my exploration into creating more intelligent and adaptable drone behavior.

## My Setup
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- ROS Noetic
- PX4-Autopilot (SITL)
- Gazebo Simulator
- MAVROS
- Python ML Environment

## What I'm Building
I'm creating an AI-driven control system that will enable drones to:
- Navigate autonomously using reinforcement learning
- Detect and track objects
- Avoid obstacles intelligently
- Coordinate in multi-drone scenarios

## My Development Roadmap
1. I'm starting with a robust ML environment setup
2. Building custom training environments in Gazebo
3. Implementing RL-based control systems
4. Developing and optimizing the training pipeline
5. Validating in simulation with potential real-world transfer

## Current Focus
My primary focus is on thoroughly understanding and configuring the environment settings and system setup. This includes mastering the PX4/ROS/Gazebo configuration parameters and ensuring optimal integration between all components. Only with a solid foundation, I'll move on to setting up the machine learning infrastructure and designing initial training scenarios. I'm working on integrating popular RL frameworks with the PX4/ROS stack to create a seamless development environment.

This project combines my interest in autonomous systems, machine learning, and robotics to push the boundaries of what's possible in drone control systems.
